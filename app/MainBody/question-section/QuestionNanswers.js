        question:"How long does it take to learn motion graphics?",
        answer:"There are a lot of factors we need to consider before deciding how long it will take you to become a motion designer, but the biggest factor that will determine how long, is the amount of time you are going to spend practicing and creating animations. If you spend a considerable amount of time every day practicing, within six months you should be job-ready, but remember the learning never stops; if you stop learning, then you stop growing."

        question:"Is Motion Graphics Difficult?",
        answer:"At first it is difficult because there are different concepts you need to understand in order to create an engaging animation, but with time it becomes less difficult, and eventually it becomes second nature. The key is to keep practicing even when it feels difficult."

        question:"Is motion graphics a highly-paid skill?",
        answer:"Motion graphics is a lucrative skill, but on its own, you can't earn much. You need to be able to network with people, sell yourself and what you do, and be business-minded."
